    OLD RULES:
    If a seat is empty (L) and there are no occupied seats adjacent to it, 
    the seat becomes occupied.
    If a seat is occupied (#) and four or more seats adjacent to it are also 
    occupied, the seat becomes empty.
    Otherwise, the seat's state does not change.

    NEW RULES:
    People don't just care about adjacent seats - they care about the first seat 
    they can see in each of those eight directions!
    
    Now, instead of considering just the eight immediately adjacent seats, consider 
    the first seat in each of those eight directions.

    Also, people seem to be more tolerant than you expected: it now takes five or 
    more visible occupied seats for an occupied seat to become empty (rather than 
    four or more from the previous rules). The other rules still apply: empty seats 
    that see no occupied seats become occupied, seats matching no rule don't change, 
    and floor never changes.
